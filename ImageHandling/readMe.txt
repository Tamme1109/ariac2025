All functions for transforming the images are in the editimage.py script, 
while editImages_main.py is the script that will take the images from a specified folder
and stochasticall apply the different transformations.

Currently no images are saved, the program is not finished yet.
Some fine tuning are also needed for the parameters in the editImages.py script.
Some work will need to be done.

testDataSet contains 5-6 images from the big data set (that contains about 3456 images? I don't remember the exact number), 
and it was used for testing.

Any questions? Just ask :D
